Four Reaction Papers
--------------------

Each reaction paper should be 2–3 pages in length. The paper should critique a week's readings. Reaction papers are due at the beginning of class, and retroactive papers (which discuss the prior week's reading are _not_ permitted).

Research Proposal
-----------------

A thoughtful, rigorous, tightly written 15–page research proposal on a topic related to international political economy. The proposal should identify a research puzzle, situate that puzzle in the relevant literature, and offer an argument with testable hypotheses to explain the puzzle. A one–page prospectus is due anytime before week #8. The research proposal is due the last week.
